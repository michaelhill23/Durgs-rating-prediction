35;2360;propecia;8;2;3;male pattern baldness;ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male pattern baldness so far one month in there is not great deal to report expected my hair loss to temporarily increase as had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones in other word hair in dead follicle will linger for few months and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new so far this has not occurred the product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place so really have not been on it long enough to judge its re growth potential in terms of halting the process however must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning so it is possible the drug is having an effect already will post fuller report in another forty seven months suppose ;i was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head like mini seconds long burst of pressure that felt like blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull this pressure would subside and would go about my day am told headaches are not one of the usual side effects so it may be an unrelated fluke however have never had such an experience before and it only manifested within about forty eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy two hours thereafter the sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided however but would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout especially if driving or in public place with bright lights and lot of noise around ;overall whether am having some sort of placebo effect reaction or not my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued prescription that same day which filled that afternoon at local pharmacy and began taking immediately the formulation was prescribed was milligram although believe the usual prescription is for milligrams and can go as high as milligrams my case was mild to begin with so it may be difficult to judge results however other than the mild side effects described above which subsided within three days must say overall that my experience has been positive one ;0.48522727272727273;0.5137700534759359;0.55;0.48854166666666665;0.5222668997668998;0.37195804195804183;162;135;114;6;32

277;661;suboxone;10;4;3;opioid addiction;suboxone is beneficial for two reasons it eliminated the opiate withdrawal when was kicking my original drug of choice as maintenance drug suboxone eliminates the cravings that would normally have for opioids as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids heroin oxycodone etc so that there is no temptation to take these drugs instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction can take suboxone and move on with life suboxone may have quite literally saved my life ;my only major complaint is that since suboxone is an opioid though different from heroin oxy etc it causes constipation due to suboxone is opioid blocking effect if pain medication were needed in hospital emergency setting there could be complications if came in to the er with broken arm and they gave me shot of morphine it would do absolutely nothing though this has not been an issue for me yet ;i am drug addict and although went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs just could not seem to stop so went on suboxone which is new alternative to methadone treatment while methadone is normal agonist opioid agonist means it gets use high it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the methadone lasts so long but methadone must be taken every day at clinic and cannot be taken home addicts can still use drugs while on methadone if they choose too it is extremely difficult to get off of and methadone still gets users high suboxone is great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home it takes care of your drug cravings but it does not get you high not exactly anyways but it does satisfy the opiate receptors enough and it is really not all that hard to get off of if you must the withdrawals are are very manageable ;0.4239583333333333;0.75;0.45982142857142855;0.5678571428571428;0.5269114219114219;0.5127855477855477;93;71;174;165;190

2360;3677;effexor-xr;8;3;3;anxiety, mild depression;venlafaxine is bicyclic antidepressant and is usually categorized as serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri but it has been referred to as serotonin norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor it works by blocking the transporter reuptake proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse the neurotransmitters affected are serotonin hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine noradrenaline additionally in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well implying that snris may also increase dopamine transmission this is because snris work by inhibiting reuptake e preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use if the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too then snris will also enhance dopaminergic transmission therefore the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine particularly in the prefrontal cortex ;difficulty in reaching orgasm increased amount of ejaculate rare mild headache ;my uptake levels were not severely out of balance started with mg and felt the positive effects in minutes was told it would take week reduced the dosage to mg then mg after six months because felt those doses to be too strong know others that found this drug helpful others it had no effect on at all even at doses of mg ;0.5035897435897436;0.40179487179487183;0.6583333333333333;0.7;0.6651515151515152;0.6393939393939394;160;11;63;16;1115

2497;1593;xanax;8;3;3;anxiety/depression;i took alprazolam for months for extreme anxiety depression it did work considerably in the beginning however would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning would wake up from naps with terrible disposition it did work considerably for anxiety initially but it is very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed in retrospect should not have taken the medication because was already on medication to come off of opiates because have an addictive personality discussed this with my dr and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression also have found out that benzodiazepines especially alprazolam can be very addictive which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate think alprazolam can be very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on prn basis do not believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice day unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day every day if you have an addictive personality like myself think if you consider alprazolam at all it should be used very judiciously but exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam like buspar which has no addiction potential however think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages suggest talking to two or more dr before initiating regimen only say this because know what alprazolam withdrawal entails and there are very unpleasant side effects which can be life threatening also alprazolam is not effective for very long it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly then it loses its effect within approx hours will also say gladly that have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks and none of them have developed dependency on them the bottom line is you know you are propensity to addiction use your own common sense and if prescribed have the dr start you on mg the lowest dose and you should see great difference in your anxiety especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines best of luck ;lethargy loss of appetite ;i was started at mg the second strength of dosage times daily became afraid of it because was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates however was already on medication to stop me from taking opiates which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression ;0.5162407407407408;0.6680000000000001;0.5;0.0;0.462037037037037;0.3398148148148148;366;4;58;9;293
